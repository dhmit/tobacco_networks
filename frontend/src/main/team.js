                                How do you sift through several decades-worth of documents from
                                the Tobacco industry to paint a cohesive picture of how its
                                major players have deceived and misled the public about the
                                dangers of smoking?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The goal of the Tobacco Networks project is to produce a network
                                visualization of roughly 1.4 million tobacco industry documents from
                                the 1970s and highlight the correspondence network of industry
                                researchers, lawyers, and marketing experts. In this way, links
                                which highlight the sinister and overwhelming efforts to
                                propagate pro-cigarette platforms, often backed by false
                                research put out by major institutions, can be clearly explored.
