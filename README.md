# tobacco_networks

To get started, clone this repository and set it up in PyCharm
just like you did with the rereading project. See the tutorial here: https://urop.dhmit.xyz/rereading.html 

Note: 
- the api does not work at (http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/) as it's not set up for this repo.  You can skip the step.
- there is no `frontend/src/App.js`. Use `frontend/src/main/main.js`
instead.
